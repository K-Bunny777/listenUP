#Instructions

Please look at the sample template. This is the way that we can create each template until we are ready to merge the entire project into one project.

If we keep them separate for now we will be able to develop all the templates in no time.

##Folders to create
-home
--css
--js
--img
--index.html
-quiz
-login
-register
