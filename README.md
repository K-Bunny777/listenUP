### Short Description:
ListenUp is a web application that is aimed to help intermediate-level foreign language learners train their listening comprehension. Through the use of Node.js, a user can create an account and progression will be tracked on what language was worked on. The user will go from the Home page to Login or Signup page, then to their Dashboard, and then select exercises, which are offered in three languages: English (EN), French (FR),and Spanish (ES). MongoDB will be used to store all appropriate information regarding user accounts and audio, visual, and answer data for exercises.
